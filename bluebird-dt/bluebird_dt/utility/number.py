def round_nearest(num: float, to: float, direction: str | None = None) -> float:
    """
    Rounds floating point number 'num' to the nearest multiple of the
    float 'to', rounded either up or down, based on the given direction. This
    uses a slow, but reliable method via the Decimal class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num : float
        Number to round.
    to : float
        Multiple of which to round 'num' to be a multiple of.
    direction : str, optional, default = None
        Direction in which to round, valid options are "down" for rounding
        towards negative infinity, "up" for rounding towards positive infinity,
        and None to use the built-in python rounding function.

    Returns
    ----------
    float
        'num' rounded to be a multiple of 'to'
